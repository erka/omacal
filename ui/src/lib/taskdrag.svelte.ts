// A task carried from the Tasks pane onto the calendar (#115).

// Dropped on an hour, the task becomes due then; dropped on a day's TASKS
// row, it becomes due that day with no hour. It stays a task either way:
// @xmha97 asked for an event only because a timed task did not seem to exist,
// and Google Calendar's own pane-to-grid drag schedules the task the same way.
//
// The pane and the grid are siblings, so the carry lives here rather than in
// either: the pane starts it and writes the drop, the grid answers "what is
// under this point" and draws where the task would land. Pointer events, not
// HTML5 drag and drop, which Tauri's own file-drop handling (the `.ics`
// import) intercepts on some platforms.
