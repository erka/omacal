 * Three rules, all about not lying:
 *
 * - A task due **at an hour** is drawn at that hour, among the meetings
 *   (2026-09-17, macOS Calendar's shape): "by 15:00" is a time, and a row
 *   that says only "Thursday" drops half of it. A task due **on a day** has
 *   no hour to be drawn at, and keeps the row.
 * - An **overdue** task is drawn in the row on today, not on the day it was
 *   due — timed or not. Its date has passed and the column for it may not
 *   even be on screen; a task that quietly leaves the week when the week
 *   moves is one nobody does. It is marked, so the day it lands on is not
 *   read as its due date, and it is not pinned to an hour of today that was
 *   never its hour.
 * - A **completed** task is left out. The grid is what still needs doing,
 *   and the sidebar's Done section is where a finished one goes.
